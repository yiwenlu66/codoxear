## Objective
Continue bounded structural/frontend refactoring on `/home/yiwen/codex-web-product-recovery`, branch `recovery/product-gaps`, while preserving the product-gap fixes already validated in `recon/refactor-entry-checkpoint.md`. Do not merge or promote it to `/home/yiwen/codex-web` or `main` without explicit user approval.

## Workbench
1. Completed tranche: polling-delay policy now lives in `codoxear/static/app_polling.js` at functional commit `6506f21 extract frontend polling helper`; checkpoint docs are being recorded separately.
2. Next tranche: extract only pure conversation-copy formatting from `app.js`; keep API export fetches, selected-session checks, clipboard writes, button disabled state, toast/error handling, and DOM event handlers in `app.js`.
3. Add fail-loud helper wiring, wrapper-preserving call sites, real-module VM tests for empty events, role labels, timestamp inclusion, text trimming, separator output, and static asset coverage.
4. Run focused Docker tests, static prefix smoke if static wiring changes, full Docker suite, clean diff review, and clean-room review before any functional commit.
5. Commit functional changes and memory/checkpoint docs separately, then refresh this list for the next tranche.

## Context
- Active checkout: `/home/yiwen/codex-web-product-recovery`.
- Protected live checkout: `/home/yiwen/codex-web` on `main`; do not edit, merge, restart, or promote it.
- Task memory: `.memory/tasks/2026-06-11-major-refactor-new-features/`.
- Current checkpoint: `recon/refactor-entry-checkpoint.md`.
- Closed work includes Pi busy-after-interrupt repair, Codex live web-send binding, Claude Code closed-log binding/API-error idle path, markdown code/table containment, video preview/transcoding, and bounded frontend helper/static-registry refactors through polling-delay extraction.
- Remaining parked limits include successful live Claude model-text response, real mobile-device/assistive-tech evidence, slow-network/huge-transcript evidence, smooth Jump to latest, non-UTF-8 Git filename byte-literal behavior, and atomic symlink containment.

## Task specifications
- Docker-only validation is acceptance evidence unless the user explicitly changes this; host validation may be diagnostic only.
- Final claims must distinguish supported behavior from parked limits.
- Do not treat stale prompt lines as active work when `recon/refactor-entry-checkpoint.md` records later evidence closing them.
- Refactors must preserve the invariants listed in `recon/refactor-entry-checkpoint.md`; no silent fallbacks.

## Constraints
- Do not edit `/home/yiwen/codex-web`.
- Do not merge or promote to `main` without explicit user approval.
- Do not touch live sessions, the live server, brokers, or backend CLI processes.
- Do not print secrets, credentials, tokens, private logs, or provider configuration values.
- Do not commit runtime artifacts, sockets, live app state, bulky scratch data, or secrets.
- Do not use `git add -A`, `git add .`, or broad staging.
